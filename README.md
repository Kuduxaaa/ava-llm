# Ava: Transformer Architecture for Causal Language Modeling

## Overview

Ava is a modular, transformer-based architecture designed for efficient and scalable causal language modeling. It integrates advanced components such as rotary embeddings, RMS normalization, and a custom attention mechanism to deliver high-performance language understanding and generation.​

## Features

-   **Modular Design**: Easily customizable components including attention mechanisms, normalization layers, and MLP blocks.
-   **Rotary Positional Embeddings**: Enhances the model's ability to capture positional information effectively.
-   **RMSNorm Integration**: Provides stable and efficient normalization across layers.
-   **Custom Attention Mechanism**: Tailored for improved context handling in causal language modeling tasks.
-   **Efficient Caching**: Supports past key-value caching for faster inference during generation.​

## Installation

To install Ava, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:​

```bash
